# Notes

## Projection Sources
- Fleet sizing, rental pricing, utilization sensitivity, and revenue projections were pulled from `MTTS Rentals & Sales Projections (1).docx` tables covering scenario mix (low/high), unit growth, rental revenue, and total revenue components for 2025–2028.
- Rental revenue uses the low/high unit counts and average monthly rates presented in the projection tables (base 2025 rate $950 with escalation through 2028).
- Total revenue combines rental revenue, chassis sales, and used truck & trailer sales as presented in the revenue breakdown table.

## Scenario Guidance
- Low and high cases represent different fleet ramp assumptions rather than operating leverage changes; utilization sensitivity is documented at 100%, 95%, and 90% but the main projections assume 100% utilization.
