# Project Status

## Done
- Core Next.js app scaffold with global layout, navigation, and section routing.
- Business registry and data loaders to make sections data-driven.
- Section layouts and reusable UI components for overview, market, model, operations,
  projections, charts, assumptions, and appendix pages.
- Narrative and visualization scaffolding (cards, grids, tables, empty states).
- Mainland Truck starter data templates for projections, assumptions, charts, tables,
  and narrative placeholders.
- Scenario planning and projection insight blocks to support investor storytelling.

## In Progress
- Data ingestion from source documents into the Mainland Truck dataset.
- Interactive projections (editable assumptions, recalculation, persistence).
- Chart rendering wired to projection data.

## Next Up (Critical Path)
1. Extract real projections, assumptions, and narratives from source docs.
2. Populate the `mainland-truck` data files with real values and citations.
3. Implement editable assumptions + recalculation logic.
4. Wire charts to projection data and render visuals.
5. Run build/lint and complete investor QA review.
